# OC Dashporter for Windows

A native Windows desktop app for remote access to your [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) installation.

OC Dashporter wraps the OpenClaw built-in Control UI in an Electron shell, giving you a proper installable app with persistent authentication — no browser, no token prompts, no storage clearing.

## Download

| OS | Download |
|---|---|
| Windows 11 | [oc-dashporter-windows-setup.exe](https://github.com/SamaritanOC/oc-dashporter/releases/latest/download/oc-dashporter-windows-setup.exe) |

---

## How it works

OC Dashporter connects directly to your OpenClaw gateway over your Tailscale network. Your gateway runs on your home machine as normal. The app is just a secure native window into it from anywhere.
```
Windows Machine
└── OC Dashporter for Windows
    └── Tailscale → Your OpenClaw gateway
                    └── All agents, models, memory, sessions
```

## Requirements

- OpenClaw installed and running on a host machine
- Tailscale with the host machine on your tailnet
- The host gateway exposed via Tailscale Serve
- Windows 11

## Host configuration

Add this to your openclaw.json gateway block:
```json
"tailscale": {
  "mode": "serve"
},
"auth": {
  "mode": "token",
  "allowTailscale": true
},
"controlUi": {
  "allowedOrigins": ["https://your-tailscale-hostname"]
}
```

## Installation

Download and run the installer:
```
oc-dashporter-windows-setup.exe
```

**Windows SmartScreen warning**

Because OC Dashporter is not yet code-signed, Windows Defender SmartScreen will show a blue warning dialog when you run the installer. This is expected for open-source apps distributed outside the Microsoft Store.

To proceed:
1. Click **More info** in the SmartScreen dialog
2. Click **Run anyway**

If you prefer to unblock the file before running it:
1. Right-click `oc-dashporter-windows-setup.exe` → **Properties**
2. At the bottom of the General tab, check **Unblock**
3. Click **OK**, then run the installer normally

Follow the on-screen prompts. A desktop shortcut and Start Menu entry will be created automatically.

## Versions

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full version history and release notes.

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| [1.0.0](https://github.com/SamaritanOC/oc-dashporter/releases/tag/windows-v1.0.0) | 2026-03-28 | Initial release |

## Updating

OC Dashporter for Windows checks for updates automatically on every launch. When a new version is available it downloads in the background and prompts you to restart to apply it.

## Troubleshooting

### App opens a blank window

Confirm Tailscale is running and connected on your Windows machine and that your OpenClaw gateway host is reachable on your tailnet.

### Pairing approval

When you open OC Dashporter for the first time, the gateway registers a new device and waits for operator approval.

**To approve:**
1. Open Mission Control or the OpenClaw webchat on your gateway host
2. Go to **Devices** — you will see a pending device entry
3. Approve it

Pairing codes expire after **1 hour**. If approval times out, close the app, reopen it, and approve the new pairing request before the hour is up.
